summary: "A random story of how did this place come to life"
---

My story basically went like this:

- I got "kind of" bored.
- I was not sure how or why or when, I rented a VPS and a domain name. You know
  the rest of the substory, I suppose.
- Actually, I "kind of" recalled the "when". It should be half a year ago.
- Recently (or a few hours ago to be more precise), I continued having the
  "brilliant idea" of blogging.
- `writefreely` should be the one to brought you this content, if I was not
  getting lazy with the finding of a new VPS.
- Here we are.

So, what should this blog be about?

- Technical stuff: I am an average developer, but my story should be interesting
  enough, hopefully.
- Non-technical stuff: I am not sure if they will be a good fit, but who knows.
  I will write about video games, or music, or the random fantasy novels I have
  read, or even vomiting some of my random incoherrent gibberings. Please
  forgive my English as I was born and raised in Vietnam and use English mostly
  by some kind of "feels".
