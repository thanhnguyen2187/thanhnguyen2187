summary: "`zsh` + `alacritty` + `vim` + `tmux`"
---


# TLDR

* `zsh` for the pretty shell.
* `alacritty` for the minimal terminal.
* `tmux` for the multitabbing.
* `vim` and a myriad of plugins for text editting.

# `zsh`

**to be worked on**

# `alacritty`

# `tmux`

`tmux` by itself is good enough, but it looks ugly and the key binding does not
fit `vim` well enough. I basically stole the configuration file in
`gpakosz/.tmux`'s but without the additional `C-a` prefix.

# `vim`
