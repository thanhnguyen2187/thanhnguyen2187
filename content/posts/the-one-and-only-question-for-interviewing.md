## TLDR:

If I work here, how will I grow, and how will the company grow? Period. End.

## Longer version:

Just look back at any "interviewing tips" article you have had, any advices,
anything you have heard. They told you to do this, or do that, or make your CV
looks better, et cetera. They are right, but they do not get to the core of the
problem. I will get it for you. Ask anything. Discuss anything. The conversation
should only surround one topic, one question: If you work at the place, how will
you grow along it.

I wrote so in the assume that you are an [] individual that is capable of
self-thinking, and a basic dream of being a millionaire, and having a question
of choosing the right job, the right boss, the right company.
