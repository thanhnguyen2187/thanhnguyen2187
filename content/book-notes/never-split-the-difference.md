## The book's structure:

> First [...] the refined techniques of [...] *Active Listening* [...] specific
> tools, turns of phrase, the ins and outs of the final act--haggling--and,
> finally, [...] the rarity that can help you achieve true ngotiating
> greatness: the Black Swan.

> Chapter 2 [...] avoid the assumptions that blind neophyte negotiators and
> replace them with *Active Listening* techniques like *Mirroring*, *Silences*,
> and the *Late-Night FM DJ Voice*. [...] how to slow things down and make your
> counterpart feel safe enough to reveal themselves; to discern between wants
> (aspirations) and needs (the bare minimum for a deal); and to laser-focus on
> what the other party has to say.

> Chapter 3 [...] *Tactical Empathy*. [...] recognize your counterpart's
> perspective [...] gain trust and understanding through *Labeling*--[...] by
> repeating that perspective back to them. [...]

## Chapter 1's takeaways:

* Prepare, prepare, and prepare.
    * Have some assumptions of what will come, but do not let it be "fixed". The
      situation itself will be the best at revealing details.
* Keep on smiling and find the "right" tone:
    * Playful/positive
    * Late-night FM DJ-ish
    * Assertive
* Try "mirroring" people (repeat the last three words or the keywords of the
  sentence)
